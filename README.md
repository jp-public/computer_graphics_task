# Task on Computer Graphics, Physical Simulation 

Aalto University CS-C3100 - Computer Graphics 

Features added: (base code provided by course staff)
R1 Euler integrator 
R2 Spring system 
R3 Trapezoid integrator 
R4 Pendulum system 
R5 Cloth system 
+ RK4 Runge-Kutta integrator. Similar to other integrators just needed to calculate more derivates.
+ Cloth tearing, added simple uniform cloth tearing effect(void ClothSystem::removeSprings(const State& state)), added toggle for it
+ Wind, added random wind effect(inline Vec3f fWind(boolean wind_), added toggle for it
